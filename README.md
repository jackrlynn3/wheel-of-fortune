# Wheel of Fortune

Wheel of Fortune is an iconic American game show in which players guess letters of a keyword in order to win money. On a player's turn, a player can spin the wheel to determine how much a correct letter is worth; the player then guesses the letter and however many times that letter appears in the keyword is however much the player gets from a turn. Alternatively, the player can buy vowels and outright guess the word. Only the player who wins the rounds gets to keep their money. **Let's start spinning!**
